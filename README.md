- First, clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/py-mine/PyMine.git` and move into that directory (`cd PyMine`)
- Next, install the required Python packages via pip (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- To run the server, you should run `server.py` from the root directory, like `python3 pymine/server.py`
- It is recommended you do not use regular Python, but [PyPy3](https://www.pypy.org/)
