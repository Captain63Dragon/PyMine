Plugins
========

PyMine has an inbuilt support for plugins which your server can leverage
and make the gameplay more fun

=============

Place the plugins in the ``plugins`` folder. The server will automatically 
load the plugin on startup.

The ``plugin.yml`` inside the each plugin stores the configuration for the plugin.

.. warning:: 
    Do not change the ``git_url`` and ``module_folder`` values. Doing so, will break the plugin!
