## Style Guide
* Use `'string'` not `"string"`
* Use f-strings (`f'{thing}'`) instead of `.format()` where possible
* After indentation changes there should be a new line
* There should be two new lines before a class or function header unless it's indented
* Unless there's a good reason, lines shouldn't be longer than 100 characters
* Use `snake_case` for variables
* Constants should either be loaded from a config file or be in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
