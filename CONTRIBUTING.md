### General Guidelines
* Use f-strings (`f'{thing}'`) instead of `.format()` where possible
* Use concatenation instead of f-strings where possible, as concatenation is faster
* Use `snake_case` for variables
* Constants should either be loaded from a config file or be in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
* Lines shouldn't be longer than 127 characters.

### Imports
* Imports should be sorted by size descending
* Imports from `pymine/*` should be separated from the rest of the imports by a newline
